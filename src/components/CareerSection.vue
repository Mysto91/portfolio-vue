            My Career So Far
        </h1>
        <p class="text-xl leading-8 font-light">
            Always up for a challenge, I have worked for lean start-ups
            and was a member of the first New Zealand start-up to attend Y Combinator,
            the largest start-up accelerator in the world. From there,
            I worked my way up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster
            where I oversaw the design of 30+ mobile and desktop apps.
            Currently I am a Senior Product Designer at Linktree leading
            design for the Linktree mobile app
